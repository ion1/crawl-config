# NOTE FOR PLAYERS OF OLD VERSIONS (DCSS 0.3.4 or before):
#
# DCSS 0.4 introduces several rather drastic changes to the interface;
# read 034_changes.txt for details. Uncomment these options if you want
# to disable them and go back to the old state:
# monster colours, command keys, order on the character selection screen,
# item colours, appearance of the stat section, butchering interface,
# targeting interface.
# The options for monster glyphs and item colours don't matter for Tiles.
# (New players should just ignore these lines.)
#
# include                 = 034_monster_glyphs.txt
# include                 = 034_command_keys.txt

# Crawl Init file
#
# On Unix systems (such as Mac OS X, Linux and the BSDs), you must copy
# init.txt to ~/.crawlrc or ~/.crawl/init.txt as:
#   cp init.txt ~/.crawlrc
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.  The basic syntax is:
#
# field = value         or      field.subfield = value
#
# Only one specification is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive except in the fairly obvious
# cases (the character's name and specifying files or directories when
# on a system that has case-sensitive filenames).
#
# White space is stripped from the beginning and end of the line, as
# well as immediately before and after the '='. If the option allows
# multiple comma/semicolon-separated terms (such as
# autopickup_exceptions), all whitespace around the separator is also
# trimmed. All other whitespace is left intact.
#
# For descriptions concerning an option consult the file
#    options_guide.txt
# in your /docs directory. Also note that the ordering of the options
# is taken from that file; this is for presentational reasons only.
#
# Note that all boolean options (i.e. values of 'true' or 'false') have
# their non-default value commented out. You can toggle these by just
# uncommenting.
# Options with several values, e.g. drop_mode = (multi | single),
# usually have the first value as default.
